# Exception-Handling-
## Theory:
An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. A C++ exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by zero.<br>
Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.<br>
<ul>
<li>try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated. It's followed by one or more catch blocks.</li>
<li>throw − A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword. </li>
<li>catch − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception. </li>

  
</ul>
